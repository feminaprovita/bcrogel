        <p>Okay, "scavenger hunt" is perhaps a bit of a misnomer, but we really love
          the church we're getting married in! And we wanted a creative way to
          welcome you all into its little details that bring us such joy. So,
          we'll be putting together a scavenger hunt of sorts: a list of features
          and images to look for throughout the church, while you're listening to
          the lovely organ concert (and/or waiting in line for confession).</p>
        <p>At the reception, the bar will have a pair of secret cocktails (one with
          booze, one without) available to anyone who participates, and ANOTHER pair
          for those who complete the list!</p>
        <p>Come, enjoy this beautiful church with us! There's so much to see!</p>
