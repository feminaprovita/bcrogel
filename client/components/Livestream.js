          <h4>If Ye Love Me –Thomas Tallis</h4>
            <p>If ye love me, keep my commandments. <br/>
              And I will pray the Father, <br/>
              and he shall give you another comforter, <br/>
              that he may 'bide with you forever; <br/>
              E'en the sp'rit of truth. <br/>
              —Jn 14:15-17</p>
          <h4>God So Loved the World –John Stainer</h4>
            <p>God so loved the world<br/>
            that he gave his only begotten Son,<br/>
            that whoso believeth in him<br/>
            should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br/>
            For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world,<br/>
            but that the world through him might be saved.</p>

            et ipse sit vobiscum, <br/>
            qui misertus est duobus unicis: <br/>
            et nunc, Domine, fac eos plenius benedicere te. <br/>
            Beati omnes qui timent Dominum: <br/>
            qui ambulant in viis ejus.</em></p>
            <p>May the God of Israel join you together; <br/>
            and may he be with you, <br/>
            who took pity upon two only children: <br/>
            and now, O Lord, make them bless thee more fully. <br/>
            Blessed are all they that fear the Lord; <br/>
            that walk in his ways.</p>
          <h4>Ubi Caritas –Maurice Duruflé</h4>
            <p><em>Ubi caritas et amor, Deus ibi est. <br/>
            Congregavit nos in unum Christi amor. <br/>
            Exultemus, et in ipso iucundemur. <br/>
            Timeamus, et amemus Deum vivum. <br/>
            Et ex corde diligamus nos sincero. Amen.</em><p/>
            <p>Where charity and love are, God is there. <br/>
            Christ's love has gathered us into one. <br/>
            Let us rejoice and be pleased in Him. <br/>
            Let us fear, and let us love the living God. <br/>
            And may we love each other with a sincere heart. Amen.</p>

            The flowers appear upon the earth.<br/>

            Jesus Christ,<br/>

            I prostrate myself and I offer you<br/>

            which is humbled in its nothingness<br/>
            and in your holy presence.<br/>
            I adore you in the Sacrament of your love,<br/>
            the ineffable Eucharist.<br/>
