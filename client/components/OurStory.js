    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <h2 className='setup'>THE SETUP</h2>
    <p className='setup'>So the key here is what we'll call Bill's college debate
    club (its actual designation is more complicated, but isn't everything?). Its
    members have a very strong sense of community, and it's normal to be active
    at alumni events long past when the people you knew graduated (and stay up
    half the night talking philosophy with friends and strangers alike). Now, this
    group attracts strong personalities, and so members of this group tend to tell
    stories about their brethren.</p>
    <p className='setup'>A brain like Claire's tries to catalog such people, to
    connect one story to another, and one day a friend was telling her about a
    conversation with a heretofore unmentioned friend from said debate club. "If
    I were ever to set you up with anybody," he explained, "this would be the guy!" </p>
    <p className='setup'>He thought this was a safe thing to say, as she'd had a
    longstanding aversion to being set up! Unbeknownst to him, she'd quietly
    changed her tune; so she asked him to please follow this impulse! Buuuuuuut
    he communicates like your stereotypical straight man, so he waited until the
    next time he saw Bill&mdash;seven months later! (In the meantime, two other
    friends from the same group were brought in on the idea, and it became a Plan.)</p>
    <p className='setup'>On that day, seven months later, Bill was attending the
    wedding of another friend from this debate club. He was barely three steps
    inside the gate when one of the Schemers made a beeline for him, greeting him
    with, "So Bill, are you still looking for a wife?"</p>
    <p className='setup'>Two hours later, the first friend cautiously broached
    the subject in conversation, careful not to push Bill into anything he wasn't
    up for (thoughtful, appreciated)&mdash;and was furious to learn he'd been
    beaten to the punch!</p>

    <h2 className='proposal'>THE PROPOSAL</h2>
    <p className='proposal'>Ring arrived Monday. Tuesday they left to visit Claire's
    family for Thanksgiving. Bill had a small window. He'd planned to bring Claire
    to Mass and adoration Tuesday morning and propose just outside the church, a
    lovely moment reflective of their relationship.</p>
    <p className='proposal'>But Claire had been stuck working very late the previous
    night (like 3am late). Claire's sister encouraged Bill's idea of a backup plan.
    When he tried to wake Claire before 7, she held a whole conversation with him
    about how badly she'd slept, how she really couldn't get up… (Fun fact: Claire
    was asleep through this whole conversation and remembers not a wit!) So he
    quickly enacted plan B, and waited.</p>
    <p className='proposal'>Claire awoke to find a note next to her pillow, with
    some sort of cute poem thing written on the front, and a rose petal on top.
    Not sufficiently awake to decode the poem, she opened the envelope and read a
    wonderful, heartfelt love letter. She went to the kitchen and thanked Bill
    for the letter… whereupon she learned that she'd been supposed to open it later. Oops.</p>
    <p className='proposal'>So, there was a scavenger hunt! A dozen roses hidden
    throughout the house. (The poem implied this, which she'd missed in her groggy
    state.) With verbal directions, she wandered around and joyfully found them all,
    finishing by placing them in her vase, which had some pretty red stuff in the
    bottom, preventing the roses from standing. She pulled the red stuff out...and
    a ring box tumbled out! He got to his knees, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
