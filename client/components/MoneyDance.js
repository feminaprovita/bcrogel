        <p>Alternately called the “bridal dance,” the “dollar dance,” or the “money
          dance,” this is a traditional feature of most Pittsburgh weddings.
          Versions of it seem to exist in various places and cultures around U.S.
          and, indeed, the world.  Here it seems to be primarily of Eastern European
          origin (as evidenced by the use of a particular polka for the dance).</p>
        <p>Guests will be asked to line up for their chance to dance with the bride
          or groom.  They will put a dollar (or more…or nothing, nobody is turned
          away) into a bag, be offered a shot, and then have approximately 30 seconds
          to dance with the bride or groom.</p>
        <p>In its most traditional form, guests would pay a dollar to dance with
          the bride (only).  At the conclusion of the bridal dance, the groom would
          have to “fight” his way through a ring of wedding guests to get to his
          bride and then the two would exit the reception together at that time.
          More recently, guests also have the opportunity to dance with the groom,
          and the couple remains at the reception until it ends.</p>
        <p>We have had to make a few tweaks.  Because fireworks are occupying the
          time that a money dance would typically occur, we are doing it right at
          the end of the meal, essentially opening the dance festivities.  Non-alcoholic
          alternatives to the “shot” will be offered.  And guests are veryencouraged
          to remain on the dance floor after their turn.  We will include the traditional
          polka, but we will NOT play the wedding polka for the entire duration of
          the bridal dance.</p>
        <p>This <em>will</em> take the place of the receiving line.</p>
