    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2 id='coronavirus-faq' className='teal'>Love in the Time of Coronavirus</h2>
    <p className='teal'>We're being careful not to
    not making any big decisions yet, but we're aware that
    the pandemic may impact our plans, and we're throwing around a variety of contingency
    plans. We will update everybody as needed, whether we make changes to the plan
    or not. The easiest way for us to keep up with you is to give us an email address
    when you <a href='http://swelltoberogel.rsvpify.com' target='blank'>RSVP</a>.</p>
    <p className='teal'>If you are not comfortable deciding on an RSVP by May 4, <a
    href='mailto:bcrogel@gmail.com'>just contact us privately</a> and we can
    work out an extension.</p>
    <p className='teal'>If you <a href='http://swelltoberogel.rsvpify.com'
    target='blank'>RSVP</a> and then feel a need to change your plans, you can update
    your <a href='http://swelltoberogel.rsvpify.com' target='blank'>RSVP</a> at
    the same link.</p>

    <h2 id='guest-transportation-faq' className='purple'>Is any transportation going
    to be provided?</h2>
      <p className='purple'>Unfortunately we are not able to bus you between locations,
      partly because we're split between <a href='/accommodations'>so many hotels</a>!
      But Ubers and Lyfts are responsive (New Yorkers, remember to allot an extra
      10m for the cab to arrive), and there's free parking at both church and casino.</p>
      <p className='purple'>Further details on church parking will be coming, both here
      and to whoever gives us an email with their <a href='http://swelltoberogel.rsvpify.com'
      target='blank'>RSVP</a>.</p>

    <h2 className='blue'>What is Pittsburgh's public transit like?</h2>
      <p className='blue'>It's limited but pretty good! The T (subway) is free downtown
      (no metrocard required, all lines making the same stops), and only $2.50
      for other trips. Buses are $2.50 ($2.75 if cash) each way, and do tend to
      arrive pretty close to on schedule. Weekend schedules are of course different
      from weekday schedules, so confirm on the <a href='https://www.portauthority.org/trip-planner/'
      target='blank'>Port Authority website</a> or Google Maps, but if you see a
      bus option, it's probably a good one.</p>
      <p className='blue'>The casino is right off the North Shore T stop, as is
      the <a href='/accommodations#hyatt'>Hyatt</a>; neither other hotel nor the
      church are within walking distance of one, but combination options are available
      (e.g., cab to nearest T station).</p>
      <p className='blue'>There is <a href='https://www.portauthority.org/pdfs/28X.pdf'
      target='blank'>exactly one bus</a> to downtown from the airport (and back);
      rumor has it it's reliable and pleasant enough (costs $3.75), but that's just hearsay. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

    <h2 id='carpooling-faq' className='teal'>Is anybody carpooling to and from Pittsburgh?</h2>
      <p className='teal'>We do anticipate carpools from nearbyish major cities,
      particularly New York, Boston, DC, and Chicago. If interested, as either
      driver or passenger, check out <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dw9l_unX_LI1XbhYc8Usmw_1kjqa2mjqKOkUtxeKZuM/edit?usp=sharing'
      target='blank'>this hidden spreadsheet</a> (shared only with wedding guests)
      and add your info. This way, y'all can contact your drivers and passengers
      yourselves!</p>
      <p className='teal'>We'll see how this spreadsheet goes, as a way of connecting
      people. But yes, carpools should totally be doable.</p>

    <h2 id='budget-lodging-faq' className='purple'>Any ideas for ultra budget accommodations?</h2>
      <p className='purple'>We have had some generous local friends offer to let individuals crash with
      them for the weekend! If you're interested, <a href='mailto:bcrogel@gmail.com'>drop
      us a line</a> and we'll connect you.</p>

    <h2 id='furries-faq' className='blue'>You said there's a convention downtown
    the same weekend?</h2>
      <p className='blue'>Yep: the world's second-largest furry convention.</p>
      <p className='blue'>Claire's explanation: <a href='https://www.buzzfeed.com/joshbergren/commonly-asked-questions-about-furries'
      target='blank'>Furries get a bad rap</a>, but they're just people, trying to
      figure out life (just in a way that looks a little different). Reportedly the
      crowd that comes to this convention is polite and kind, and happy to take
      pictures with kids who think they're characters...</p>
      <p className='blue'>Bill's explanation: What? No. They're weirdos. Harmless
      weirdos, but weirdos.</p>

    <h2 id='dress-code-faq' className='teal'>How dressed up should I get?</h2>
      <p className='teal'>Wear what you'd wear to any other wedding. Nothing fancy
      is required.</p>
      <p className='teal'>That being said, if extra formal is fun, or if you've
      had your eye on that hat since the last royal wedding and we're your Excuse,
      then go wild.</p>

    <h2 id='kids-faq' className='purple'>What's the deal with the kids?</h2>
      <p className='purple'>We're going to have a lot of them! So many that we're hiring
      babysitters for the reception, possibly playing a movie that'll end before the
      fireworks show starts.</p>
      <p className='purple'>All kids will be welcome in the ballroom and on the dance
      floor, but we're also providing an alternative space where they can go and
      color pictures and play with toys and hang out with their peers (and be out
      of their parents' hair once mealtime is over).</p>
      <p className='purple'>If you're able to bring a toy that doesn't have to come
      home with you, something your kids can share and leave behind, we'd be happy
      for the help!</p>

    <h2 id='cookie-table-faq' className='blue'>Tell me about this ‚Äúcookie table.‚Äù</h2>
      <p className='blue'>A local tradition in Pittsburgh and a few other Midwestern
      cities, a <a href='/cookietable' target='blank'>cookie table</a> is a little
      like a buffet of homemade cookies: some guests bring cookies, and everyone
      gets to eat them throughout the reception, and bring some home!</p>
    <h3 className='blue'>Do I need to bake cookies for it?</h3>
      <p className='blue'>No, if that sounds stressful, then don't. If you know
      where you can buy the best cookies, you're welcome to buy some, but this
      tradition works out; not everybody brings cookies to every wedding.</p>
    <h3 className='blue'>But can I bake cookies if I want to?</h3>
      <p className='blue'>Absolutely! Check out our <a href='/cookietable'
      target='blank'>cookie table</a> page for more details, bring as many as you
      like, and <a href='/cookietable#dropoff'>drop them off when you can</a>. It's
      fantastic to see the spread of everyone's favorite treats.</p>

    <h2 id='confession-faq' className='teal'>Why are you offering confession before
    your wedding?</h2>
      <p className='teal'>When you've got this many priests on the invite list, might
      as well put 'em to work! Besides, so many people show up early to get a good seat;
      this just seems like a prudent use of time!</p>
      <p className='teal'>Anyway, we intend to go to confession that morning, so
      we can receive three sacraments in one day! Seemed the least we could do, to
      offer you the opportunity to pick up two, if you want.</p>

    <h2 id='scavenger-hunt-faq' className='purple'>Scavenger hunt?</h2>
      <p className='purple'>We had the silly idea of offering a scavenger hunt of sorts
      as a way to invite you all to enjoy this beautiful church we're getting married
      in: <a href='scavengerhunt'>we'll give you a list</a> of things to look for (
      on the back of the Mass program), and if you find some or all of them, there
      will be a secret cocktail or two open to you at the reception bar (one boozy
      and one virgin cocktail each, for participation and for completion).</p>

    <h2 id='money-dance-faq' className='blue'>Tell me about the ‚ÄúMoney Dance‚Äù!</h2>
      <p className='blue'>The money dance is a local wedding tradition of Eastern
      European origin. In short: pay a dollar, take a shot, dance with the bride
      or groom. More details <a href='/moneydance'>here</a>.</p>
      <p className='blue'>This <em>will</em> take the place of the receiving line.</p>

    <h2 id='cigars-faq' className='teal'>What's the deal with the cigars at the
    end of the reception? Are you not having a formal exit?</h2>
      <p className='teal'>The reception ends at 11, but we're going to head outside
      with whoever wants to join us to smoke some celebratory cigars! All our guests
      are welcome.</p>
      <p className='teal'>So no, we are not having a formal exit.</p>

    <h2 id='baseball-faq' className='purple'>What's going on with this baseball game?</h2>
      <p className='purple'>This is not an official wedding event! But Bill was
      able to reserve a block of tickets, and we knew that enough of our loved
      ones would enjoy the game, so we're able to offer them to you at a substantial
      discount! More details <a href='/baseball' target='blank'>here</a>; direct booking
      link <a href='https://groupmatics.events/event/Gilliganrogel' target='blank'>here</a>.</p>
      <p className='purple'>We are corresponding with our contact at the Pirates
      about what happens in the case of the season's or game's cancellation, refunds
      and whatnot. We'll update <a href='/baseball/'>our baseball page</a> as we
      learn more.</p>

    <h3 className='blue'><em>We'll continue to update this as people ask questions,
    so check back in at your leisure (and keep asking us your questions)!</em></h3>
