    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <h2>We were set up by friends!</h2>
    <h3 className='hers'>Her Story</h3>
    <p className='hers'>So I have this one atheist friend who likes to talk theology. Just enjoys
      discussing minutiae, and knows that I've a well-educated perspective,
      so some mornings I'll wake up to questions like "What will our bodies
      look like in heaven, and how do we know?" or "If all the priests on earth
      died all at once, how would Catholics have Mass?" Great stuff.</p>
    <p className='hers'>Anyway, so my atheist friend texts me one day, "We need to talk about
      miracles. I am more skeptical of miracles than I'd thought." (I don't
      know how you get <em>more</em> skeptical than radical materialism, but,
      great, sounds like fun.) The next time I saw him, I poked him about this,
      but we didn't have time to get into it, so instead he told me where the
      statement came from.</p>
    <p className='hers'>At the reunion weekend of his college debate club the preceding weekend,
      he'd stayed up half the night talking about miracles with this other alum,
      and, how should he describe this guy&mdash;"If I were ever gonna set you
      up with anyone, this'd be the guy." (This had seemed a safe statement,
      see, due to my longstanding opposition to setups. Unbeknownst to my friend,
      however, I'd recently reversed this position...)</p>
    <p className='hers'>I encouraged him to act on this intuition! But, because this dear,
      beloved friend of mine communicates like your stereotypical straight man,
      he waited until the next time he saw Bill in person, 7 months later, to
      say anything!</p>
    <p className='hers'>During this time, I sent out an email to a couple dozen friends, asking
      them to set me up with their friends (100% of the fruit of which was Bill),
      and my atheist friend joined forces with a couple from the same debate
      club who knows us both. And the delay turned out to be a good thing anyway,
      as God used it to prepare my heart for Bill in ways I never would have predicted (healing I didn't realize I needed &etc).</p>

    <h3 className='his'>His Story</h3>
    <p className='his'>(Some text here)</p>
    <h2>Emails, Texting, and Visiting</h2>
    <p className='hers'>It was apparent from the first emails that there was
      something real here. My mindset was kind of, <en>If this isn't gonna work
      out, let's torpedo it from the beginning, save us both some trouble</en>,
      so I was just 110% me from the getgo! Starting with: People say to be short
      and sweet, but I'm bad at that and find it stressful, so here's a 6-paragraph
      email. You don't need to respond at length.</p>
    <p className='hers'>Reader, his response email was LONGER than mine! And arrived
        well under 24h later! And was just exceptionally interesting.</p>
    <p className='hers'>By a week later, our daily emails were taking about four
      hours to write&mdash;and not because we were going back and editing, just
      because we were adding so much content! We quickly escalated to texting,
      and put a visit on the calendar.</p>
