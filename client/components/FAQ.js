    <h2 className='teal'>What is this "cookie table"?</h2>
      <p className='teal'>A local tradition in Pittsburgh and a few other Midwestern
      cities, a <a href='/cookietable' target='blank'>cookie table</a> is a little
      like a buffet of homemade cookies: some guests bring cookies, and everyone
      gets to eat them throughout the reception, and bring some home!</p>
    <h3 className='teal'>Do I need to bake cookies for it?</h3>
      <p className='teal'>No, if that sounds stressful, then don't. If you know
      where you can buy the best cookies, you're welcome to buy some, but this
      tradition works out; not everybody brings cookies to every wedding.</p>
    <h3 className='teal'>But can I bake cookies if I want to?</h3>
      <p className='teal'>Absolutely! Check out our <a href='/cookietable'
      target='blank'>cookie table</a> page for more details, bring as many as you
      like, and drop them off when you can. It's fantastic to see the spread of
      everyone's favorite treats.</p>
    <h2 className='purple'>Tell me about the "Money Dance"</h2>
    <h2 className='blue'>What's the deal with the cigars at the end of the reception?
      Are you not having a formal exit?</h2>
      <p className='blue'>The reception ends at 11, but we're going to head outside
      with whoever wants to join us to smoke some celebratory cigars! All our guests
      are welcome.</p>
      <p className='blue'>So no, we are not having a formal exit.</p>
    <h2 className='teal'>What's this about a scavenger hunt before the wedding Mass?</h2>
    <h2 className='purple'>Why are you offering confession before your wedding?</h2>
      <p className='purple'>When you've got this many priests on the invite list, might
      as well put 'em to work! Besides, so many people show up early to get a good seat;
      this just seems like a prudent use of time!</p>
      <p className='purple'>Anyway, we intend to go to confession that morning, so
      we can receive three sacraments in one day! Seemed the least we could do, to
      offer you the opportunity to pick up two, if you want.</p>
    <h2 className='blue'>How dressed up should I get?</h2>
      <p className='blue'>Wear what you'd wear to any other wedding. Nothing fancy
      is required.</p>
      <p className='blue'>That being said, if extra formal is fun, or if you've
      had your eye on that hat since the last royal wedding and we're your Excuse,
      then go wild.</p>
    <h2 className='teal'>What's the deal with the kids?</h2>
      <p className='teal'>We're going to have a lot of them! So many that we're hiring
       babysitters for the reception, possibly playing a movie that'll end before the
       fireworks show starts.</p>
       <p className='teal'>All kids will be welcome in the ballroom and on the dance
       floor, but we're also providing an alternative space where they can go and
       color pictures and play with toys and hang out with their peers (and be out
       of their parents' hair once mealtime is over).</p>
    <h2 className='purple'>Is transportation going to be provided between the hotels and the church?</h2>
    <h2 className='purple'>Is transportation going to be provided between the church and the casino?</h2>
    <h2 className='purple'>Is transportation going to be provided between the casino and the hotels?</h2>
    <h2 className='blue'>What's going on with this baseball game?</h2>
      <p className='blue'>This is not an official wedding event! But Bill was able to reserve a block
        of tickets, and we knew that enough of our loved ones would enjoy the game,
        so we're able to offer them to you at a substantial discount! More
        details <a href='/baseball' target='blank'>here</a>; direct booking
