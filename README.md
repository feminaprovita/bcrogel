# Wedding website for Claire Gilligan and Bill Rogel

[Here it is! Our wedding website! Click here to see it!](bcrogel.herokuapp.com)

Could we have done this the easy way, gone through the knot or somebody? Yeah of course. But I'm a software engineer, for crying out loud! And was job searching when we began to seriously talk about marriage. No, obviously I'm going to building this myself.

Unfortunately, I'm not yet a pro at SEO, so Google favors this page, the coding skeleton of the website, to the page itself! So [here's a link](bcrogel.herokuapp.com) to our wedding website. We look forward to celebrating with you!
