    <h1>About the Pittsburgh Cookie Table</h1>
    <p>You're welcome to join us in preparing this beloved Pittsburgh tradition
      (or to just join in eating them; that's ok, too)! Family and friends of the
      bride and groom prepare cookies up to weeks in advance (often their most
      celebrated recipes), and bring them to the wedding reception, to be enjoyed
      by guests throughout the evening and brought home after the festivities are
      over!</p>
    <p>Pittsburghers who wish to make cookies for our cookie table should please
      either drop them off at the casino during business hours the week before
      the wedding OR leave them with the Rogels no later than Thursday night 7/2
      to be brought over.</p>
    <p>Out-of-town guests are likewise welcome to bring cookies for the cookie table!
      Just bring them with you to the reception; there staff members will be available
      to take your cookies and plate them on the big table.</p>
