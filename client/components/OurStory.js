    <h3 className='hers'>Her Story</h3>
    <p className='hers'>So I have this one atheist friend who likes to talk theology. Just enjoys
      discussing minutiae, and knows that I've a well-educated perspective,
      so some mornings I'll wake up to questions like "What will our bodies
      look like in heaven, and how do we know?" or "If all the priests on earth
      died all at once, how would Catholics have Mass?" Great stuff.</p>
    <p className='hers'>Anyway, so my atheist friend texts me one day, "We need to talk about
      miracles. I am more skeptical of miracles than I'd thought." (I don't
      know how you get <em>more</em> skeptical than radical materialism, but this
      is a pretty normal conversation for us, so...) The next time I saw him, I
      poked him about this, but we didn't have time to get into it, so instead he
      told me where the statement had come from.</p>
    <p className='hers'>At the reunion weekend of his college debate club the preceding weekend,
      he'd stayed up half the night talking about miracles with this other alum,
      and, how should he describe this guy&mdash;"If I were ever gonna set you
      up with anyone, this'd be the guy." (This had seemed a safe statement,
      see, due to my longstanding opposition to setups. Unbeknownst to my friend,
      however, I'd recently reversed this position...)</p>
    <p className='hers'>I encouraged him to act on this intuition! But, because this dear,
      beloved friend of mine communicates like your stereotypical straight man,
      he waited until the next time he saw Bill in person, 7 months later, to
      say anything!</p>
    <p className='hers'>During this time, I sent out an email to a couple dozen friends, asking
      them to set me up with their friends (100% of the fruit of which was Bill),
      and my atheist friend joined forces with a couple from the same debate
      club who knows us both. And the delay turned out to be a good thing anyway,
      as God used it to prepare my heart for Bill in ways I never would have predicted (healing I didn't realize I needed &etc).</p>

    <h3 className='his'>His Story</h3>
    <p className='his'>(Some text here)</p>
    <h2>Emails, Texting, and Visiting</h2>
    <p className='hers'>It was apparent from the first emails that there was
      something real here. My mindset was kind of, <em>If this isn't gonna work
      out, let's torpedo it from the beginning, save us both some trouble</em>,
      so I was just 110% me from the getgo! Starting with: People say to be short
      and sweet, but I'm bad at that and find it stressful, so here's a 6-paragraph
      email. You don't need to respond at length.</p>
    <p className='hers'>Reader, his response email was LONGER than mine! And arrived
        well under 24h later! And was just exceptionally interesting.</p>
    <p className='hers'>By a week later, our daily emails were taking about four
      hours to write&mdash;and not because we were going back and editing, just
      because we were adding so much content! We quickly escalated to texting,
      and put a visit on the calendar.</p>
    <p className='hers'>Just as we began texting, I was off to the vacation I take
      every few summers with my college friends (in which we adults are more than
      outnumbered by the adorable kiddos), and I was pleased to note that Bill
      was not at all intimidated by the sudden presence of 8 thousand children in
      my life, but rather was returning stories of his delightful own nieces and
      nephews! Somebody who enjoys being an uncle the way he does is ready to start
      a family. This was one of many good signs I noted as we were enjoying each
      other's company more and more.</p>
    <p className='hers'>By the time he arrived for the scheduled visit, I was
      confident this was going to be something, even if I wasn't sure quite what.
      Knowing that he'd seriously inujured his leg some months earlier, I tried
      to minimize the walking in our trip, but he'd minimized the injury's impact
      on his daily life, and showing him my favorite things/places in NYC requires
      some amount of walking, so I just (foolishly) asked him to let me know he
      needed a break if things got too much, and soldiered on.</p>
    <p className='hers'>We had a really lovely day: Mass, <a href='https://govisland.com/'>Governor's Island</a>,
      one of the best <a href='https://www.vanbruntstillhouse.com/'>distillery tour</a>s I've ever attended,
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao'> soup dumplings</a>,
      <a href='https://www.facebook.com/FrozenSweetNYC/'> Thai ice cream</a>,
      <a href='https://www.theastoriannyc.com/home'> my favorite cocktail bar</a>,
      a walk through the park near my apt, with its skyline views... It was really
      just wonderful. The next day I made sure he had a proper bagel, then Mass
      at <a href='http://www.svsc.info/'>my parish</a>, lunch with mutual friends,
      and then he was off! A short visit, but worth every second.</p>
    <p className='hers'>It became pretty quickly apparent that Bill couldn't leave
      Pittsburgh (that whole "named partner" thing, terrible) but Claire could
      leave New York (there are tech jobs everywhere!), and Claire very quickly
      stopped feeling any peace about continuing to search for jobs in NYC. Sure
      enough, a cursory search in Pittsburgh yielded more promise immediately than
      her months of searching in New York had gotten her, and the decision was made&mdash;to
      Pittsburgh!</p>
    <p className='his'>(I imagine these parts here include some mockery for the walking...)</p>
    {/* <p className='his'>...</p> */}
    <h2>Pittsburgh and Engagement</h2>
    <p className='hers'>Details just kept falling into place: Friends to live with,
        logistics of moving... In the midst of planning all this, Bill accompanied
        Claire to her sister Theresa's wedding in Charlotte, then (a week later!)
        to her bridesmaid Anna's wedding in <em>Hong Kong</em>!</p>
    <p className='his'>(Something about meeting the whole family here, perhaps?)</p>
    <p className='hers'>At some point between the "deciding to move to Pittsburgh"
      part and the "arriving in Pittsburgh" part, I realized I no longer had any
      doubts about marrying Bill, and (rather than give myself the headache of
      trying to suss out when "the right time" is to convey that) I promptly relayed
      this to him üòÇ. He pretended to be overwhelmed, as he stereotypically should
      have been, but I wasn't fooled for a second. What did surprise me, though,
      was that he was just as certain, and just as ready! We took a little time to
      bask in the wonder of this beautiful certainty, and then one day Bill texted
      me available dates at the church near his office, where he often attends
      Mass during the week. This threw the planner in me into high gear (but he
      started it)!</p>
    <p className='hers'>As time went by, we secured the church, chose a venue,
      looked at dresses and colors and photographers... And <em>everybody </em>
      started to give Bill a hard time about the lack of ring on my finger! But I
      wasn't worried. I knew it'd come as soon as it was ready.</p>
    <p className='his'>(The plan/setup? Everything up to when I actually woke up?)</p>
    <p className='hers'>Please note that I have no memory of any of this; I held
      that entire conversation in my sleep! So I woke up around 9 to use the bathroom
      (deduced by the light out the window that he hadn't tried to wake me for Mass,
      whoops)... and, like a terrible lazybones, I lay right back down on the bed
      and rolled over. At which point I noticed an envelope with a cryptic but
      romantic poem thing and a rose petal. Charmed (and suspecting I knew the
      endgame here), I opened, read, and appreciated the letter.</p>
    <p className='hers'>Then I came out to the kitchen and thanked him for the
      sweet letter, and he, flustered, went, "...no! You were supposed to open
      that after! Didn't you see the poem?" In response to my objection that "I'm
      nowhere near awake enough for that kind of nuance," he sent me on a scavenger
      hunt around the house: find the dozen roses hidden in the various rooms!
      (They uhhh weren't hidden very hard. That part was very well suited to the
      amount of awake I was.)</p>
    <p className='hers'>So we've been gradually integrating my stuff into his, right?
      Well, one of the roses was sitting in my vase, hiding inside a cleaned-out
      cabinet. It was sort of held in place by this pretty red papery gauzey stuff,
      which I just presumed came with the flowers. Didn't give this a second thought
      until I finished gathering my roses, and went to put them in the vase, but
      this lovely red thing was in the way; they wouldn't stay, even for the hour
      until we left. So Bill, astute as ever, gently suggested that I remove the
      red thing (I would have gotten there eventually, probably). When I did, quite
      to my surprise, a ring box came tumbling out! And he got on one knee, declared
      his love again succinctly, and asked The Question. <em>Of course</em> I said
      yes and kissed him! üòç</p>
    <p className='his'>...</p>
