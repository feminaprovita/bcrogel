          <p className='caption'>The graffiti behind us reads, "Happiness is in the air" (And yes, Claire was walking around with a blanket while Bill was comfortably wearing no coat; don't judge)</p>

          />
          <p className='caption'>As you've clearly noticed by now, we've been trying to take a picture at every notable sports game. These guys behind us were making faces as we framed our sad photo (because the Steelers were playing poorly)...</p>

          />
          <p className='caption'>Bill's first Jet game! It was a tough battle, but (as predicted) Claire's Jets *did* manage to lose to the Bills! (Both teams tried so hard to lose that day.) And he's marrying Claire anyway, amazing.</p>

          />
          <p className='caption'>Bill always complains that it looks ridiculous when Claire does this to his hair, but that's no motivation to stop, so he's gonna hafta either get used to it or get more haircuts...</p>

          <p className='caption'>The reason we were in Hong Kong in the first place was for a friend's wedding; at their reception, we couldn't resist posing in front of the "Love Station"!</p>

          <p className='caption'>One of our favorite photos together, taken by a cousin (thanks, Maggie!) at Claire's sister's wedding&mdash;after Bill had just spent a bunch of time meeting Claire's <em>entire</em> family for the first time, while she was busy with maid of honor duties and couldn't even run interference...</p>

          />
          <p className='caption'>This delightful Indian wedding reception was right here in Pittsburgh! Such a joy (and not <em>just</em> because no travel was required, though that didn't hurt).</p>

          />
          <p className='caption'>I suppose mismatches are a theme for us! We've been trying to cook for ourselves, and we're as silly about that as we are about everything else.</p>

          />
          <p className='caption'>Bill picked that out all by himself! (Ok, with help from the jeweler, but still.) The proposal involved a scavenger hunt of roses. What a brilliant job!</p>
