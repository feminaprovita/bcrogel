    <p>Thank you for agreeing to sing at our wedding! We are overjoyed to have you.</p>
    <p>Here you will find all the music for our wedding: sheet music, youtube recordings, etc.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The one major downside of the <em>gorgeous</em> church we're getting married
    at is that it was designed to have the choir sit in the sanctuary (there's no
    loft!). So you will unfortunately be front and center. We have no interest in a
    choir dress code, but did want to warn you that you're stuck up front so it's
    not a nasty surprise.</p>
